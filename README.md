terminal-soundboard
===================

A small bash-script which maps your number keys to soundfile in a folder you specify. See if you have mplayer installed (because you will need it to play, obviously) and change the folder in line three to your needs and you are ready to go.

This is nothing special at all, but might become useful for somebody someday. Enjoy!
